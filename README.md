# React Todo App

This is a sample react todo app done step-by-step.

This is a forked repo for which I have created Cypress test using Page Object Model and integrated it with the Github Workflow to demonstrate how you can implement testing with CI.


## Instructions

First clone this repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/react-todo-app.git
```

```bash
$ npm install # or yarn
```

Run it

```

Run the Cypress test in UI mode
```bash
